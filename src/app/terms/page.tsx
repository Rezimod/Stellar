          <p>
            Stellar is a set of collectible cards, each a numbered edition of a real object or a dated event in the sky. It is run
            by Astroman (astroman.ge). Live Telescope V1, the telescope that photographs the night&rsquo;s card, is commissioning: until it is
            operational, no photograph is promised.

          <Chapter n="02" title="Your account" />
          <p>
            You log in through Privy with email or a wallet. Your cards are held against the Solana wallet on that account.
            Keep the account to yourself; whoever controls it controls the cards.
          </p>

        <section className="sd-chapter-block">
          <Chapter n="03" title="Capsules and cards" />
          <p>
            A capsule holds one card, drawn under the published odds and committed by hash before it goes on sale. The public{' '}
            <Link href="/capsules/log">log</Link> records every listing, sale and opening, and anyone can recompute a draw after
            it is opened. A card bought directly is the next free edition of that card. Prices are shown in US dollars and
            charged in SOL at the rate quoted at checkout; a quote holds for fifteen minutes.

        <section className="sd-chapter-block">
          <Chapter n="04" title="What a card is not" />
          <p>
            A card is a record of an edition in this collection. It carries no promise of financial value, resale or return.
            Buy a capsule for the cards and the photographs to come, not as an investment.

        <section className="sd-chapter-block">
          <Chapter n="05" title="What each rarity gives" />
          <p>
            Legendary cards carry a physical item: a piece of the meteorite, or of the Moon, that the card shows. These items are
            planned, not yet shipping. How to redeem one, and where it can be sent, will be published here before any item ships.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each edition of an Epic card is one 30-minute session on Live Telescope V1, and each edition of a Rare card is one entry
            in the draw for a visitor&rsquo;s seat at a live session. Live Telescope V1 is commissioning; sessions and visitor
            seats open with it, and how they are booked and drawn will be published here first. Every card votes on the night&rsquo;s
            target, with the weight shown on the card.

            If a payment lands and nothing is delivered, because a card sold out between order and payment or a capsule was
            withdrawn, write to us with the transaction and we will refund it by hand. Opened capsules are final.

          <p>
            These terms change as Stellar does. The date above moves when they do, and continuing to use Stellar after a change
            means accepting it. Questions go to <Link href="/contact">Contact</Link>.
