/**
 * The boundary between Stellar and a telescope.

 * Stellar never talks to hardware — it talks to an adapter. One implementation

 * platform. See docs/observatory-network.md §4, including the rule that no
 * node platform's source may enter this repository.
 *
 * The interface is deliberately small. Booking, mission leases and command
 * envelopes join it when the booking slice lands; adding them now would be
 * shape without behaviour.
