/**
 * The mission machine.
 *
 * An acquisition — everything between "go to that" and "you are looking at it"
 * — is planned as a deterministic timeline the moment the command is accepted.
 * `acquisitionStateAt` is then pure: the same instant always yields the same
 * state, on the server and in the browser, in a test at 1000x or on a roof in
 * real time. No timers, no drift, nothing to resynchronise.
 *
 * Once the mission reaches OBSERVING it is interactive: a capture appends a
 * phase, a new GoTo replaces the plan.
