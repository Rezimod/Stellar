// Player spacecraft for Explore Mode — Stellar's own survey ship and
// interceptor flying the real solar system, with four speed regimes,
// gravity wells, solid planets you can crash into, a shield-then-hull
// damage model, a navigation target, an expedition log, and a hyperdrive
// that jumps to the next star.
//
// Everything here is scene-scale. The ephemeris scene is tiny (Earth radius
// ≈ 0.028, alien saucer ≈ 0.012), so flight numbers live in "flight units"
// of FLIGHT_UNIT scene units and the hull in H, a fraction of that: the ship
// is about a third of an Earth radius long, so every planet towers over it.
//
// Geometry lives in ship-mesh.ts, the chase camera in flight-camera.ts,
// desktop input in flight-input.ts, the two surviving sounds in
// flight-audio.ts, the expedition log in flight-missions.ts and target maths in
// flight-targeting.ts. This file is the flight model and the glue.
