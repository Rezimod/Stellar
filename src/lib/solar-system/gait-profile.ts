// What a person's legs can do under a given gravity, worked out rather than
// tuned. Everything the locomotion needs comes from g, the leg, the mass of
// the body and of what it is wearing, and how hard legs can push; the only
// numbers of a game's own are the speeds an Earth-bound character jogs,
// runs and sprints at, and a floor under the jump so a heavy world still
// gives a hop. No world has a number of its own here.
//
// The walk is an inverted pendulum and cannot go faster than √(Fr·g·leg)
// with Fr ≈ 0.5; past that the body must leave the ground. A game jog sits
// above that limit on the Moon and Mars, so there the default gait is a
// lope with real flight between strides; on a heavy world it is a fast
// walk. The legs push about 2.4 g of the body's own weight through a
// fixed depth, so a jump's take-off speed is √(2·(F/m − g)·d): the Moon
// hangs, Mars hops, Proxima b barely leaves the ground. Landing is the
// same push run backwards, which sets the soft / roll / hard thresholds.
