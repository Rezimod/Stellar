// What the stick means on foot, for every surface and every controller.
// The stick is in the camera's frame; the walk wants it in the world's. Its
// length picks the gait — a nudge is a walk, most of the way is a jog, hard
// over is a run — and Shift is a sprint whether held or tapped: a tap
// latches until the stick is let go, so a thumb on a phone gets the same
// deal as a finger on a key.
