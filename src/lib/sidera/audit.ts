/**
 * Reading the capsule log for what it should not contain.
 *
 * Pure: it takes the published rows and nothing else, so anyone holding a copy
 * of the log can run it. What it looks for is the evidence a selective abort
 * leaves behind. A capsule is listed, with a sequence number and a
 * commitment, before it can be sold; so a server that throws away an outcome
 * it does not like has these options, and each is visible here:
 *
 *   - erase the capsule from the log      → a gap in the listing sequence
 *   - sell it and never open it            → purchased, not opened
 *   - sell it and void it                  → voided after purchase
 *   - sell it and release it while paid    → released with an on-time payment
 *
 * None of these is proof of bad faith on its own — an unpaid order is voided
 * after purchase too — which is why a void or release reveals the secret and
 * a reason. What the log shows and is expected (a purchase released after its
 * payment window closed unpaid, a capsule withdrawn unsold) is reported as a
 * note, not a flag.
 *
 * Direct card sales are logged too ('card_sold'), so every edition a capsule's
 * logged supply says was gone can be matched against an entry that took it.
