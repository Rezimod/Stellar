 * Card rarity.

 * Stored on the card when a set is authored, never computed from anything a
 * holder does. How scarce a card is has nothing to do with whether Live Telescope V1 can
 * photograph it: Europa is common and cannot be resolved; Saturn is epic
 * and can.

 * The tiers minted into old Stellar observation metadata (`Stellar`,
 * `Celestial`, `Astral`) are a different vocabulary and stay in nft-rarity.ts.
