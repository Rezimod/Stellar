/**
 * The four capsules on the shelf, cheapest first. Each is named for something
 * brighter in the sky than the last, and the odds climb with the price. The
 * keys keep the meteorite classes they were first listed under.
 *
 * PROVISIONAL (Gate 2). A capsule is listed as one tier and keeps its odds
 * from then on (capsule.odds_bps, and its 'listed' log entry), so changing a
 * row here changes only capsules listed after. Odds are parts per ten
 * thousand and each row sums to exactly 10,000.
 *
 * Checked against First Light's supply (12,600 / 3,400 / 480 / 40 editions)
 * at a shelf of 40 / 25 / 10 / 5: the 40 legendaries last about 1,700
 * capsules, the epics about 3,000. That was at two cards a capsule; at one,
 * each lasts about twice as many capsules.
