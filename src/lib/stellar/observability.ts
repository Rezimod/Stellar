/**
 * Can Node 01 photograph what this card shows?
 *
 * A card's observation_status is decided here, from the instrument and the
 * site, not typed by hand. The rule is checked in order and the first failure
 * is the reason given, most physical first:
 *
 *   1. Never high enough. A fixed object whose meridian altitude from the site
 *      stays under the safety envelope's floor (20°) is never worked.
 *   2. Too small to resolve. If the card is about a detail — a disc, a crater,
 *      a pair — that detail must be at least as large as the finer of the two
 *      real limits, which at Tbilisi is always the air: Dawes' limit for 150 mm
 *      is 0.77", typical seeing is 2.6". Europa's disc, about 1" at its best,
 *      is a point.
 *   3. Too faint to record. The integrated magnitude must be inside
 *      limitingMagnitude() for the deepest stack the node takes unattended
 *      (60 x 8 s) under the node's Bortle class.
 *   4. Too diffuse for the city. An extended object's mean surface brightness
 *      may be at most 3.5 mag/arcsec² fainter than the sky — at Bortle 8, a sky
 *      of about 18.5, that is 22.0. The Orion Nebula passes on its bright core;
 *      the Pinwheel and Triangulum galaxies do not.
 *   5. Too large for the field. An object more than three times the widest
 *      field the node can take (the f/6.3 reducer, about 41') is only ever a
 *      fragment. The Andromeda Galaxy is 178'.
 *   6. Not carried. The node photographs only what its capture path knows
 *      (SIM_TARGET_BY_ID). The one reason a code change can lift, and so the
 *      last one reported.
 *
 * Passing all six is `eligible`. `dedicated` — a showcase object the node
 * photographs as a matter of course — is withheld while the node is not
 * active: an instrument that has not yet taken a frame has no showcase. Once
 * active, it is granted only to a bright-regime target whose subject spans at
 * least ten resolution elements (26" at Tbilisi), so the frame shows structure
 * and does not wait on a dark, transparent night.
