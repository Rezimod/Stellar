/**
 * Paying for Stellar: capsules and single cards, on the existing orders table
 * and the existing Solana Pay rail. A card processor is out of scope for beta.
 *
 * An order is created pending with a fresh reference key and a quote that
 * stands for ORDER_WINDOW_MINUTES; it becomes paid only once a transaction
 * carrying that key is found that validateTransfer confirms paid the merchant
 * the order's amount, and its block time is inside the window. A
 * transfer that arrives later is recorded as refund_due, never dropped. The
 * pending → paid step is one conditional UPDATE, so a confirmation retried or
